In this training we learn to create, test and implement Docker containers with practical and real activities, starting with understanding what a container is and how it works. We perform hands-on activities in virtual labs to understand how containers are created and deployed in real infrastructure. Once we understand what a container is, we work with them using basic Docker CLI commands. After that, we learned how to create your own custom images and how to store them in the cloud or on an on-premises infrastructure. The Training also covers creating a container cluster using specific AWS tools and also how to create a container cluster on an on-premises infrastructure.
